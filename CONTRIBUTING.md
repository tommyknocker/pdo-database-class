## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/README.md) and checked the [Examples](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/tree/master/examples).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

### Common Questions

**Q: Which database should I use for development/testing?**
A: SQLite is recommended for development as it requires no setup. All examples work with SQLite by default.

**Q: How do I handle different SQL dialects?**
A: PdoDb automatically handles dialect differences. Use helper functions like `Db::concat()` instead of raw SQL when possible.

**Q: Can I use this in production?**
A: Yes! PdoDb is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, connection pooling, and extensive testing.

**Q: How do I contribute examples?**
A: Add new examples to the `examples/` directory and ensure they work with `composer test-examples`.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/issues/new) with the "question" label
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into
- Include:
  - PHP version
  - Database type and version (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite)
  - PdoDb version
  - Code example that demonstrates your question
  - Expected vs actual behavior

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum
-->

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - **PHP version** (e.g., PHP 8.4.13)
  - **Database type and version** (MySQL 8.0, PostgreSQL 15, SQLite 3.38, etc.)
  - **PdoDb version** (check `composer show tommyknocker/pdo-database-class`)
  - **OS and platform** (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - **Stack trace** - Full error output
  - **SQL query** - The actual SQL being generated (use `toSql()` method)
  - **Minimal reproduction code** - Smallest code that reproduces the issue
  - **Expected vs actual behavior** - What should happen vs what actually happens
  - **Can you reproduce it reliably?** - Does it happen every time?
  - **Does it happen with older PdoDb versions?** - Test with previous versions

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> **Security Issues**: You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead, security issues must be sent by email to <vasiliy@krivoplyas.com> with the subject "SECURITY: PdoDb vulnerability report".
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for PdoDb, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version of PdoDb
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/README.md) and check the [examples](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/tree/master/examples) to see if the functionality already exists
- Check if there's already a helper function in `Db::` that provides similar functionality
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested
- Consider if the feature should work across all supported databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Evaluate if the enhancement fits with PdoDb's philosophy of being lightweight and framework-agnostic
- Think about whether this would be useful to the majority of users or just a small subset

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tommyknocker/pdo-database-class/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion
- Provide a **step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement with code examples
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead**
- **Include code examples** showing:
  - Current way of achieving the goal (if possible)
  - Proposed new API or functionality
  - Expected SQL output (if applicable)
- **Explain the use case** - When would this feature be useful?
- **Consider cross-database compatibility** - Should this work on MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite?
- **Provide implementation ideas** (optional) - If you have thoughts on how this could be implemented
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most PdoDb users
- **Reference similar features** in other database libraries if applicable

## Styleguides

### Code Style

We use **PHP CS Fixer** with PSR-12 rules. Run `composer cs-fix` to automatically format your code.

**Key style requirements:**
- **PSR-12 compliance** - Follow PHP-FIG standards
- **Strict types** - Always use `declare(strict_types=1);`
- **Type hints** - Use proper type declarations for all parameters and return values
- **PHPDoc** - Document all public methods with proper `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` tags
- **Array syntax** - Use short array syntax `[]` instead of `array()`
- **No unused imports** - Remove unused `use` statements

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

**Format:** `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests

**Examples:**
```
feat: add automatic external reference detection in subqueries
fix: resolve PostgreSQL ambiguous column errors in UPSERT
docs: update README with new batch processing examples
test: add comprehensive tests for external reference detection
chore: update dependencies and improve CI configuration
```

**Best practices:**
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Keep PRs focused** - One feature or fix per PR
